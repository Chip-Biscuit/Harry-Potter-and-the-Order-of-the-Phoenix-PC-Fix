Make sure you launch the game one time before you use this fix, go to new game or continue game, go to video and make sure your resolution is 640 x 480 for the d3d9.dll to work 

simply go to releases download hpootpfix120fps.zip or hpootpfix60fps.zip depending on which fps you wish the game to run at put the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini and fps.dll into your game folder next to the game exe and your good to go 

choose your release (60fps or 120fps). If your monitor is 60hz choose 60fps. If your monitor is 120hz or more choose 120fps. leave v-sync on on your pc and leave the fps at its value.

you can edit settings in d3d9.ini 

Default for resolution is 2 (1920 x 1080) 

Default for aspect ratio is 0 which is (16:9)

The game will start with the origional FOV and you can toggle it to the FOV you select here by pressing the hotkey "9" on your keyboard (not the numpad) and it will toggle between origional and the value in the ini that you choose to zoom out to.
