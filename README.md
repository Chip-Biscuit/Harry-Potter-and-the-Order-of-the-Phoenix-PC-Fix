# Instructions
You must launch the game once before you use this fix. You will either need to start a new game or continue a save file and go to the video settings and make sure your resolution is 640 x 480 in order for the d3d9.dll file to work.

Go to releases, download the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Fix that fits the requirements you need, then extract the d3d9.dll, d3d9.ini and the fps.dll files into your game folder next to the hp.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
The default for resolution is set to (1920 x 1080). Put the resolution that you wish to use in both Width and Height. If you boot up the game after setting the resolution you want in the d3d9.ini file and the resolution has not changed automatically then go to the video options menu in game and select your resolution from in there.

The default for aspect ratio is (0) which is (16:9). Choose the aspect ratio that is correct for you from the selection within the d3d9.ini file and replace (0) with the number correct for you.

# FPS
Choose one of the releases of either (60fps or 120fps) to use. If your monitor is 60hz then choose the 60fps release. If your monitor is 120hz or more choose the 120fps release.

# FOV
You can choose in the d3d9.ini file of either 1, 2 or 3 each will zoom the FOV/camera in the game out slightly more. Choose which option you want to use and it will be reflected in the game, 0 is off or original game cameras zoom FOV.
