Watch the official fix guide video here on how to install the game and use the fix - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeZ-Envz9ME&t=58s

# Instructions
You must launch the game once before you use this fix. You will either need to start a new game or continue a save file and go to the video settings and make sure your resolution is 640 x 480 in order for the d3d9.dll file to work.

Go to releases, download the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Fix that fits the requirements you need, then extract the d3d9.dll, d3d9.ini and the fps.dll files into your game folder next to the hp.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
The default for resolution is set to (1920 x 1080). Put the resolution that you wish to use in both Width and Height. If you boot up the game after setting the resolution you want in the d3d9.ini file and the resolution has not changed automatically then go to the video options menu in game and select your resolution from in there.

The default for aspect ratio is (0) which is (16:9). Choose the aspect ratio that is correct for you from the selection within the d3d9.ini file and replace (0) with the number correct for you.
